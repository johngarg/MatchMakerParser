* MatchMakerParser

A small tool to parse Mathematica expressions from MatchMaker into Python code.

** Workflow
How do we want this to work? Last meeting we discussed an output like:
#+begin_src python
matching_instance = MatchingResults(scale=1000, yLQ=np.matrix([[1, 7j, 0],[...],[...]]), ...)
matching_instance.get_coeff("Clq(1)", [1,1,1,1])
#+end_src
This means that nothing will need to be symbolic within the dataclass. Initialise the objects with sensible values so that only the matrix will need to be updated.

** Thoughts on a Numpy interface

There is an idea to actually use =numpy= to perform fast matrix multiplication,
since =sympy= can recognise matrix summations:
#+begin_src python
import sympy as sym
import numpy as np
from numpy import dot

from sympy.abc import i,j,k,l

X = sym.MatrixSymbol("X", 2, 2)
matrix_expr = sym.MatrixExpr.from_index_summation(sym.Sum(X[i,j]*X[i,k], (i, 0, 1)))
func = sym.lambdify(X, matrix_expr, modules='numpy')

npX = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
func(npX)
#+end_src
It's not clear if this will be quicker than just using =Sympy= to perform the matrix multiplication, or just the sum directly using =summation= for that matter!
