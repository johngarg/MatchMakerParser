* MatchMakerParser

A small tool to parse Mathematica expressions from MatchMaker into Python code.

** Usage
The package provides the main executable ~parse-matchmaker-output~:
#+begin_src bash
./parse-matchmaker-output S1 S1Config.m S1MatchingData.dat s1_matching.py
#+end_src
The first argument is the name of the process (will enter the name of the
Python class constructed), the second is the config file that defines couplings,
the third is the path to the Matchmaker output, and the last is the desired path
for the python output file.
